Welcome to Batch_Crystallizer_Simulator's documentation!
==========================================================
This program simulates the batch cooling crystallizer with size independent nucleation rate and growth rate kinetic. The crystal size distribution is solved through method of moment and coordinate transformation proposed by Vollmer and Raisch (1).  The simulation result including final crystal size distribution and growth rate trajectory can be exported as csv file for further data processing.
